Android app for real time image captioning on the phone - In Development

I will use the tensoflow model I trained in my ImageCaptioning repository and try to deploy it in the adnroid application. I will transform the model to TensorflowLite and try to run it on the Android.

1 ---- First step is to just create a simple camera app using Camera 2 API
2 ---- Create Classifier and ClassifierListener class for getiing each frame and running it through the TFlite Interpreter
3 ---- See the Results
